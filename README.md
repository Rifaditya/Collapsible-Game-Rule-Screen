# ⚒️ Collapsible Game Rules

**No Backports:** This mod targets **Minecraft 26.1+** (Snapshot 8). Older versions are unsupported.

> **Respect the Player's Time, Not the Game's Rules.**

**Collapsible Game Rules** makes the GameRules UI screens collapsible by category. Are you tired of scrolling through a massive, unorganized list of game rules every time you create a world or tweak settings? This mod solves the clutter by turning the standard Game Rules screen into a clean, easy-to-navigate interface.

## ✨ Features

### 🗂️ Collapsible Categories
Minecraft game rules are automatically grouped by their default categories (Player, Mobs, Spawning, Updates, etc.). Instead of a giant flat list, you get a clean, organized view.

### 🖱️ Toggle Headers
Click on any category header to instantly expand or collapse its contents. Find the settings you need without scrolling continuously!

### 🛡️ Client-Side Only
Works out of the box on your client. You do not need to install this on a server. Just drop it into your `mods` folder and enjoy a cleaner UI immediately.

### 🧩 Seamless Mod Support
Our collapsing logic hooks directly into the game's native Game Rules map. This means **any custom categories or rules added by other mods** will be automatically organized and collapsible out-of-the-box!

### ⚙️ Zero Configuration
No config files or messy setup required. It seamlessly integrates into the Vanilla UI and automatically formats everything without needing manual tweaks.
