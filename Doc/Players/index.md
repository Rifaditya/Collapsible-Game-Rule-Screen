# Player Guide

**Collapsible Game Rules** organizes the Minecraft Game Rules screen into collapsing categories to save you time and scrolling effort.

## Features
- **Collapsible Categories**: Game rules are automatically grouped under their parent category (e.g. Spawning, Player, Mobs).
- **Toggle Headers**: Click any category header to expand or collapse the rules inside it.

## Configuration
There are no configuration files to manage. The mod operates purely client-side and seamlessly integrates with the Vanilla screen automatically.
